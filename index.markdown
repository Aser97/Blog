ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aser Lompo!
I hold an MSc in Mathematics and Machine Learning, with a strong focus on Visual Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning, and Applied Mathematics. My work is driven by a passion for advancing multimodal AI and finding elegant ways to bridge theory and application.

Iâ€™m especially interested in NLP, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, and Mathematicsâ€”fields where rigorous foundations meet exciting real-world impact. Here youâ€™ll find my research projects, publications, and portfolio.

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
