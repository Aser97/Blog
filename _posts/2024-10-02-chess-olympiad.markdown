The Chess Olympiads are the biggest event in the world of chess. Every two years this international event gather all the nations members (198) of the Internation Chess Federation (FIDE) in a team vs team format to decide the greatest nation in chess. I had the immense privilege to represent Burkina Faso for their first participation in this event

This year edition's was extremely awaited for several reasons.
First, this edition was celebrating the 100th anniversary of FIDE. For this occasion an olympic torch was turned on and crossed many nations from Eastern Europe to Western America, passing by Africa and Asia. The olympic torch concluded its journey in the hands of the legendary Judith Polgar (best female chess player of all time) who carried it in Budapest (her hometown) for the grandiose opening ceremony of the olympiads.

The second reason was the very anticipated clash between the legends of the old generation (Magnus Carlsen , Fabiano Caruana, Levon Aronian, Ding Liren etc.) and the rising young talents (Gukesh D., Pragnanandha R., Nodirbek A., etc.). Since the pandemic 2020, Chess has never been so popular and thousands of fans were regularly following the tournament from everywhere. Among all the stories and intrigues that happened during the tournament, the main one will definetly be the historic performance of the Indian team who won first place and their leader Gukesh D. (challenger for the World Champion match later this year) had an historical Elo performance of 3000, second highest in the history of the tournament.
